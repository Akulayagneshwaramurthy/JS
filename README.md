## 🌦️ Weather App Using JavaScript

This is a simple and interactive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean and modern UI.


## 🔧 Features

🌍 Default weather shows for Rajahmundry on load.

🔎 Search for any city to get real-time:

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Wind Speed (Km/Hr)

Weather condition icon

🧠 Remembers previously searched cities using autocomplete.

🌈 Stylish and responsive design with gradient backgrounds and animated icons.

## 💡 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6+)

OpenWeatherMap API

![Items Added](https://github.com/Akulayagneshwaramurthy/JS/blob/main/weather-3.png)


## 📦 How It Works

The app loads with default city Rajahmundry's weather.

When a user enters another city in the search bar, it fetches weather data via:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?units=metric&q={city}&appid={API_KEY}

It displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather image accordingly.

The app stores recent search history for quick access in the future.
